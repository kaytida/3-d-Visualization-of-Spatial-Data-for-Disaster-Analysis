# 3D Imaging of Spatial Data for Disaster Analysis

This project visualizes disaster data of forest cover, active volcanoes, and earthquakes on a 3D Earth model using OpenGL, SQL, and numpy. The data is obtained from Google Earth Engine and Earth Explorer, and processed using SQL queries and numpy operations. The 3D Earth model is rendered using OpenGL, and the disaster data is overlaid on it using different colors and shapes.

## Features

- Interactive 3D Earth model that can be rotated, zoomed, and panned using mouse and keyboard inputs
- Visualization of forest cover, active volcanoes, and earthquakes using different colors and shapes
- Customizable parameters for data filtering, such as date range, magnitude, and location
- Export option to save the 3D Earth model and the disaster data as an image file

## Installation

To install this project, you need to have Python 3.7 or higher, and the following libraries:

- OpenGL
- SQL
- numpy

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install numpy
```

This will open a window with the 3D Earth model and the disaster data.
