					Satellite Dataset Insights

				<p class="overlay__description">
					A two-line element set (TLE) is a data format encoding a list of orbital elements of an
					Earth-orbiting object for a given point in time, the epoch. Using a suitable prediction formula, the
					state (position and velocity) at any point in the past or future can be estimated to some accuracy.
					The estimated data can be used to visualize the trajectory of the satellite.
				</p>

				<br>

				<br>
				<h3>LANDSAT</h3>
				<br>
				<p class="overlay__description">The Landsat Program is a series of Earth-observing satellite missions
					jointly managed by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey.Landsat satellites have the optimal ground
					resolution and spectral bands to efficiently track land use and to document land change due to
					climate change, urbanization, drought, wildfire, biomass changes (carbon assessments), and a host of
					other natural and human-caused changes.The Landsat 7 satellite orbits the the Earth in a sun-synchronous,
					near-polar orbit, at an altitude of 705 km (438 mi), inclined at 98.2
					degrees, and circles the Earth every 99 minutes. </p>
				<br>

				<h3>SENTINEL</h3>
				<br>
				<p class="overlay__description">Sentinel is a family of European Union Earth observation missions that
					aim to provide continuous and reliable data for monitoring environmental changes, managing natural
					resources, and supporting security and humanitarian activities. The Sentinel program is managed by
					the European Space Agency (ESA) in partnership with the European Commission.There are currently
					seven Sentinel satellites in orbit, each equipped with different sensors and instruments that
					capture a range of data types, including optical, radar, and atmospheric measurements. The Sentinel
					satellites operate in a polar, sun-synchronous orbit, which means that they pass over the same area
					of the Earth at the same time of day, allowing for consistent observations over time.</p>
				<br>

				<h3>ISS</h3>
				<br>
				<p class="overlay__description">The ISS (International Space Station) is not a satellite, but rather a
					large spacecraft that is in orbit around the Earth. It is a joint project of five space agencies,
					including NASA (USA), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada).It orbits the
					Earth at an altitude of approximately 408 kilometers, completing one orbit every 90 minutes.The ISS
					serves as a laboratory for scientific research in areas such as physics, biology, and meteorology.
					It also plays an important role in testing new technologies for space exploration, as well as in
					supporting the development of human spaceflight capabilities.
